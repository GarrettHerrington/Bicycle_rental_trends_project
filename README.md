# Bicycle_rental_trends_project
Bicycle rental business projections

For this project I looked at a bicycle rental company and created a linear regression model that would take a set of predictors (weather, what time of day it was, temperature), and estimate how many bicycles would be rented based upon that.
I also implemented a time series forecasting where I tried to estimate what the bicycle rental outlook would be for future business analytics.  The time series did not turn out as I'd hoped, I think there may not have been enough data, or perhaps I applied the models inappropriately, in future projects I'll spend more time on time series.
